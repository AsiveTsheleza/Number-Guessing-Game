# Number Guessing Game

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**! The game will randomly pick a number between 1 and 100, and you need to guess it in as few attempts as possible. This is a fun game that will test your ability to guess a number based on feedback from the game.

## How to Play

1. The game will randomly select a number between 1 and 100.
2. You have a total of **10 attempts** to guess the correct number.
3. After each guess, the game will tell you if your guess is:
   - Too low
   - Too high
   - Correct
4. If you guess the correct number within 10 attempts, you win!
5. If you run out of attempts, you lose, and the game will reveal the correct number.
